# SMIF Portfolio Analysis

**Clarkson University Student Managed Investment Fund**  
**Portfolio Snapshot:** September 5, 2024  
**Analysis Date:** January 11, 2026  
**Analyst:** Rufaro Chimaga  
**Faculty Advisor:** Prof. Alan Zebedee

## Executive Summary

I joined the SMIF as Portfolio Manager in August 2024, inheriting a 45-position portfolio valued at $486,820 with 7.1% cash. This analysis examines the portfolio's risk profile, factor exposures, and performance drivers to understand where the 85.91% cumulative return came from and what risks exist going forward.

**Portfolio Composition:**
- 45 equity positions
- $486,820 total value
- $34,357 cash (7.06%)
- 85.91% cumulative return
- 84.4% win rate (38 winners, 7 losers)

**Risk Metrics:**
- Estimated CAGR: 21.5%
- Sharpe Ratio: 2.76
- Sortino Ratio: 26.73
- Portfolio Beta: 1.08
- HHI: 0.0396 (25.3 effective stocks)
- Active Share: 22.3%

The portfolio demonstrates strong historical performance, but the source of this outperformance matters critically. The top 3 positions generated 41.7% of returns from just 21.6% of capital. Technology exposure at 37.8% captured three consecutive years of sector leadership, but now sits 9.7 percentage points overweight versus the S&P 500. Growth factor tilt of +0.52 benefited from unprecedented growth dominance since 2020, but creates rotation risk. High-momentum positions at 27% weight generated 48.3% of returns but face historical crash risk of 35-47% during reversals.

## Performance Attribution

### Return Concentration Analysis

The performance concentrates heavily in specific positions rather than broad diversification. Just three holdings contribute 41.7% of total returns while representing only 21.6% of weight.

**Top Contributors:**

| Position | Weight | Return | Contribution | Risk |
|----------|--------|--------|--------------|------|
| AAPL | 9.15% | 887.97% | 19.1% | 11.7% |
| UNH | 6.11% | 936.44% | 12.9% | 7.8% |
| META | 6.35% | 189.33% | 9.7% | 6.5% |
| COST | 4.53% | 94.34% | 5.1% | 4.3% |
| INTU | 3.16% | 224.60% | 5.1% | 3.5% |

The top 10 positions produced 73.3% of gains from 48.3% of capital. The remaining 35 positions generated only 26.7% of returns while consuming 51.7% of capital. This tells me most alpha came from concentrated stock selection rather than broad portfolio construction.

### Risk-Adjusted Performance Context

The Sharpe ratio of 2.76 substantially exceeds typical active manager benchmarks. For context, the S&P 500 averaged roughly 0.9 from 2015-2024, while active equity funds typically achieve 0.7 to 1.0. Our 2.76 indicates strong risk-adjusted returns.

The Sortino ratio of 26.73 reveals why the win rate sits at 84.4%. With only 5.1% of portfolio weight in losing positions, most volatility comes from upside rather than downside. Average winners returned 173% while average losers declined just 21%, demonstrating effective loss management.

## Sector Positioning and Market Context

### Current Allocation vs S&P 500

The portfolio shows meaningful deviations from benchmark weights, creating active exposures that explain performance patterns.

| Sector | Portfolio | S&P 500 | Difference | 2024 Return | 2025 Return |
|--------|-----------|---------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Technology | 37.8% | 28.1% | +9.7pp | +37.0% | +24.4% |
| Consumer Disc | 16.0% | 10.5% | +5.5pp | NA | +6.2% |
| Healthcare | 8.0% | 13.6% | -5.6pp | NA | +13.2% |
| Financials | 10.1% | 13.1% | -3.0pp | NA | +14.2% |
| Industrials | 5.8% | 8.8% | -3.0pp | NA | +18.7% |
| Energy | 5.4% | 4.8% | +0.6pp | NA | +5.5% |
| Real Estate | 2.5% | 2.8% | -0.3pp | NA | +0.6% |
| Utilities | 1.5% | 2.7% | -1.2pp | NA | +13.4% |

Source: Fidelity Viewpoints 2025 Stock Market Report, AssetMark Q4 2024 Quarterly Market Review

The 37.8% technology allocation represents our largest active bet, overweight by 9.7 percentage points. This captured technology's leadership across three consecutive years: +60% in 2023, +37% in 2024, and +24.4% in 2025 per Fidelity data.

### Technology Subsector Breakdown

Within technology, holdings span different subsectors with varying AI infrastructure exposure:

| Subsector | Holdings | Weight | Characteristics |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Hardware | AAPL | 9.8% | Services growth, mature iPhone cycles |
| Internet | META, GOOGL | 10.3% | Advertising revenue, AI infrastructure |
| Software | MSFT, INTU, CRM | 7.9% | Recurring SaaS, high margins |
| Semiconductors | TSM, LRCX, INTC | 7.9% | Cyclical, China risk |
| IT Services | CACI, FFIV | 1.9% | Government contracts, stable |

This internal diversification provides some protection, but all technology positions benefited from the same AI infrastructure narrative. Goldman Sachs Research published in December 2025 shows AI hyperscaler capital expenditure reaching $527 billion for 2026, up from $465 billion consensus at Q3 earnings. This concentrated spending in AI buildout resembles late 1990s telecom investment, where thematic capex eventually normalized causing sector corrections.

### 2024-2025 Market Performance

According to AssetMark's Q4 2024 Quarterly Market Review, the S&P 500 climbed 25% in 2024, notching 57 record highs. The market delivered two consecutive years of 20%+ returns, a feat not seen since the late 1990s. The Magnificent Seven stocks accounted for 55% of the index's return in 2024. Market concentration reached historic levels, with top 10 stocks comprising 39% of the S&P 500, surpassing previous peaks. Only 30% of individual stocks outperformed the index, near post-1990 lows.

This bifurcated market means our concentrated positioning in mega caps captured narrow leadership but creates fragility if that leadership rotates. AssetMark emphasizes using the S&P 500 as sole benchmark becomes problematic when not all stocks participate equally.

The 2025 environment showed moderation but continued technology dominance. The S&P 500 gained 17.3%, with communication services leading at 33% and technology at 24.4%. This marked the third consecutive year of double-digit gains and technology outperformance. Fidelity research indicates approximately 60% of GDP growth in 2025 was driven by AI infrastructure buildout, representing concentrated thematic spending rather than broad economic expansion.

## Factor Analysis

### Growth vs Value Positioning

I classified each position by growth, value, or blend characteristics based on business models, valuation multiples, and growth profiles.

**Portfolio Composition:**

| Factor | Positions | Weight | Avg CAGR | Contribution |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|
| Growth | 15 | 46.3% | 23.9% | 58.4% |
| Blend/Quality | 20 | 39.0% | 19.4% | 36.1% |
| Value | 10 | 14.7% | -3.1% | 5.5% |

The growth/value score = (46.3% - 14.7%) / (46.3% + 14.7%) = +0.52

This strong growth tilt explains much historical outperformance. Growth outperformed value by approximately 135 percentage points cumulatively from 2020-2025 per Fama-French data and AQR research. AssetMark confirms growth stocks beat value throughout 2024 as investors bet on AI.

However, this creates asymmetric risk. Growth has dominated for five consecutive years. When growth underperforms value, as in 2022 and 2000-2002, growth-tilted portfolios experience magnified drawdowns. A scenario where growth declines 15% while value gains 10% would produce roughly 7.4% portfolio loss based on current allocations.

### Momentum Exposure

High-momentum positions (CAGR above 30%) represent 27% of portfolio weight but generated 48.3% of returns.

**High-Momentum Holdings:**

| Symbol | Weight | CAGR | Return |
|--------|--------|------|--------|
| AAPL | 9.15% | 38.7% | 887.97% |
| UNH | 6.11% | 39.7% | 936.44% |
| META | 6.35% | 30.4% | 189.33% |
| DECK | 0.90% | 44.2% | 1196.08% |
| STRL | 1.12% | 41.6% | 1043.82% |
| BX | 1.43% | 30.3% | 275.18% |

Academic research by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) shows momentum persists 6-12 months before mean-reverting. Historical crashes include March 2000 (47% decline in 8 weeks), October 2008 (42% in 4 weeks), and March 2020 (38% in 3 weeks). A conservative 35% correction on our 27% momentum exposure would produce approximately 9.5% portfolio impact.

Goldman Sachs Research from December 2025 shows relevant context. Stock price correlation across AI hyperscalers declined from 80% in June to just 20% by December. Investors have begun discriminating between winners and losers within the previously monolithic AI trade. This selective positioning often precedes broader momentum reversals.

### Quality Factor Strength

Quality stocks demonstrate strong profitability, balance sheets, business durability, and competitive advantages. I classified 53.2% as high quality.

**Quality Performance:**

| Tier | Weight | Avg CAGR | Avg Sharpe | Contribution |
|------|--------|----------|------------|--------------|
| High Quality | 53.2% | 24.4% | 0.45 | 67.2% |
| Medium Quality | 19.8% | 20.5% | 0.33 | 18.6% |
| Lower Quality | 27.0% | 4.7% | 0.01 | 14.2% |

The 84.4% win rate stems largely from quality bias. Five of seven losing positions fall into lower quality categories: CVS, CCI, INTC, HI, GEO. High-quality companies rarely experience permanent capital impairment. The 45-fold difference in Sharpe ratios between high quality (0.45) and lower quality (0.01) validates quality's importance.

Goldman Sachs Research notes investors have rewarded companies demonstrating clear links between capex and revenues, while rotating away from companies where operating earnings face pressure despite high spending. This validates quality factor importance even within high-growth sectors.

### Size Distribution

**Market Cap Allocation:**

| Size | Weight | Avg CAGR |
|------|--------|----------|
| Mega Cap (>$500B) | 26.9% | 22.5% |
| Large Cap ($50B-$500B) | 37.0% | 23.1% |
| Mid Cap ($5B-$50B) | 16.4% | 9.5% |
| Small Cap (<$5B) | 19.8% | 9.9% |

The 63.8% allocation to mega and large cap provides stability. AssetMark confirms small caps trailed large caps in 2024, gaining only 8.7% versus 25% for the S&P 500. However, small cap positions like STRL (1043.82% return) and DECK (1196.08% return) contributed disproportionately despite representing just 2.02% combined weight.

## Risk Analysis

### Concentration Metrics

The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index measures concentration: HHI = Σ(Weight^2) = 0.0396

This produces effective number of stocks = 1 / 0.0396 = 25.3. The portfolio behaves like 25 equal-weighted positions despite holding 45 stocks. For comparison, 45 equal weights would produce HHI = 0.0222, showing our portfolio is 78% more concentrated due to top 10 holdings at 48.3%.

Active Share = 0.5 × Σ|Portfolio Weight - Benchmark Weight| = 22.3%

This indicates moderate active management. Above 60% represents concentrated bets, below 20% suggests closet indexing. Our 22.3% shows deliberate sector positioning, primarily the 9.7 percentage point technology overweight.

AssetMark documents market concentration reaching historic extremes. The Magnificent Seven accounted for 55% of S&P 500 return in 2024, with top 10 stocks comprising 39% of index weight. Only 30% of stocks outperformed. Our portfolio holds four Magnificent Seven stocks (AAPL, META, GOOGL, AMZN) at 22.36% combined weight, amplifying rather than diversifying away from market-level concentration.

### Position-Level Risk Contribution

Efficient positions show Return Contribution > Risk Contribution.

**Efficient Positions:**
- AAPL: 19.1% return vs 11.7% risk (1.63 ratio)
- UNH: 12.9% return vs 7.8% risk (1.65 ratio)
- META: 9.7% return vs 6.5% risk (1.49 ratio)

**Inefficient Positions:**
- CVS: -0.6% return vs 0.4% risk (-1.63 ratio)
- CCI: -0.6% return vs 0.5% risk (-1.25 ratio)
- UPS: -0.5% return vs 1.6% risk (-0.31 ratio)

The Sharpe ratio of 2.76 derives primarily from 5-7 highly efficient positions rather than broad alpha across all names.

## Scenario Analysis

### Technology Sector Correction

A 20% technology decline would significantly impact the portfolio given 37.8% allocation. Using estimated sector beta of 1.15, technology positions would decline approximately 23%.

**Calculation:**
- Technology exposure: $183,780
- Expected decline: 23%
- Dollar loss: $42,269
- Portfolio impact: -8.7%
- New value: $444,551

**Largest Impacts:**
- AAPL: $10,240 loss
- META: $7,112 loss
- TSM: $4,321 loss
- GOOGL: $3,610 loss

Goldman Sachs Research from December 2025 provides context. AI hyperscaler capex consensus stands at $527 billion for 2026, with analysts consistently underestimating for two years. However, current AI capex at 0.8% of GDP sits below historical tech boom peaks of 1.5%. Data center capacity scenarios range from continued tightening through 2030 to occupancy dropping to 80% if monetization disappoints.

The research notes that timing of an eventual slowdown in capex growth poses risk to valuations. If AI spending normalizes, technology positions face correction risk. AssetMark observes the current market delivered two consecutive years of 20%+ returns not seen since late 1990s, with concentration surpassing previous peaks. The parallel suggests elevated mean-reversion risk.

### Growth to Value Rotation

**Conservative Scenario:**
- Growth stocks: -15%
- Value stocks: +10%
- Blend positions: -5%

**Impact:**
- Growth: $225,019 × -0.15 = -$33,753
- Value: $71,482 × 0.10 = +$7,148
- Blend: $189,858 × -0.05 = -$9,493
- Net: -$36,098 (-7.4%)
- New value: $450,722

AssetMark notes the 10-year Treasury yield rose 70 basis points in 2024 to 4.58% despite Fed cuts, based on deficit concerns. Higher real yields favor value over growth. Small caps trailed significantly with only 8.7% gains, creating potential energy for mean reversion.

### Momentum Reversal

Using conservative 35% decline on high-momentum positions:

**Impact:**
- High-momentum exposure: $131,440 (27%)
- Expected decline: 35%
- Dollar loss: $46,004
- Portfolio impact: -9.5%
- New value: $440,816

**Most Vulnerable:**
- AAPL: $15,583 loss
- UNH: $10,413 loss
- META: $10,822 loss

Momentum reversals trigger cascading selling as risk-parity funds delever, momentum ETFs mechanically sell, and margin calls force liquidations. Goldman Sachs documents correlation across AI hyperscalers declining from 80% to 20%, suggesting early stage discrimination within the momentum trade.

### Recession Scenario

Economic recessions affect sectors differently. Cyclicals typically decline 30-40%, defensives 5-15%, technology 20-25%.

**Sector Impacts:**
- Cyclicals (XLY, XLI, XLF, XLE): $156,912 at -30% = -$47,074
- Defensives (XLV, XLU): $43,465 at -5% = -$2,173
- Technology: $183,780 at -20% = -$36,756
- Other: -15% average = -$10,558

**Total:**
- Combined loss: $96,561
- Portfolio impact: -19.8%
- New value: $390,259

Defensive exposure of only 8.9% creates vulnerability. The S&P 500 typically maintains 20-25% defensive allocation during downturns. Our 8.9% versus 32.3% cyclical weight creates asymmetric downside.

Goldman Sachs data center research identifies recession as a specific risk scenario. Their AI Downside case shows occupancy dropping to 80% if economy slows or monetization weakens. This linkage between economic weakness and AI infrastructure creates amplified recession risk for technology positions.

## Methodology and Data Sources

### Calculation Approach

Without historical time-series data, I employed cross-sectional estimation techniques. The September 5, 2024 snapshot provides position weights, returns, and cost basis but not daily prices over time.

**CAGR Estimation Example:**

For AAPL with 887.97% return:
- Estimated holding: 7 years (based on return magnitude)
- CAGR = (1 + 8.8797)^(1/7) - 1 = 38.7%
- Verification: $1.00 × (1.387)^7 = $9.88 ✓

Holding periods use rules: <20% suggests 1 year, 20-50% suggests 2 years, 50-100% suggests 3 years, 100-200% suggests 4 years, 200-500% suggests 5 years, >500% suggests 7 years.

**Volatility Estimation:**

Base assumption: 35% annual volatility for individual stocks (Ibbotson Associates research). Adjustments for return magnitude (high returns suggest higher volatility) and position size (small positions tend more volatile).

Portfolio volatility: Variance = Σ(Weight^2 × Volatility^2) = 0.0082. Square root yields 9.1%. Applying diversification factor of 0.70 (assumes 0.60 correlation) produces 6.4% portfolio volatility.

**Sharpe Ratio:**

Sharpe = (21.5% - 4.0%) / 6.4% = 2.76

The 4.0% risk-free rate approximates 10-year Treasury yield in September 2024. AssetMark notes the yield reached 4.58% by year end, validating this assumption.

**Beta Estimation:**

Without regression, I used sector-weighted calculations with typical betas from academic research: Technology 1.15, Financials 1.20, Healthcare 0.90, Consumer Disc 1.10, Industrials 1.05, Energy 1.25, Utilities 0.70, Real Estate 0.95. Portfolio beta = 1.08.

### Limitations

**Data Constraints:**
- Single snapshot prevents true beta, volatility, or drawdown calculation
- Holding periods approximate actual purchase dates
- Volatility uses cross-sectional estimation
- Correlations based on sector similarity

**Confidence Levels:**

High confidence: position weights, total returns, sector allocations, Active Share

Medium confidence: portfolio CAGR, Sharpe ratio, factor classifications

Lower confidence: individual volatilities, correlation estimates, beta estimates

**Appropriate Uses:**

This analysis suits cross-sectional risk assessment, concentration identification, scenario stress testing, and relative positioning versus benchmarks. It provides directional insights but cannot provide precise performance attribution, predict exact timing, or support short-term trading.

Goldman Sachs Research validates scenario analysis as standard practice. Their December 2025 publications model multiple scenarios (base case, AI Downside, bullish) with different assumptions about AI spending, data center occupancy, and economic conditions.

## Key Findings

**Exceptional Risk-Adjusted Returns with Concentration:**

The Sharpe ratio of 2.76 and Sortino ratio of 26.73 indicate strong performance substantially exceeding benchmarks. However, this stems from 5-7 highly efficient positions rather than broad alpha. AssetMark shows the Magnificent Seven accounted for 55% of S&P 500 return in 2024, with only 30% of stocks outperforming. Our concentrated positioning in AAPL, UNH, and META captured narrow market leadership driving overall returns.

**Technology Positioning and AI Infrastructure Exposure:**

The 37.8% technology allocation with 9.7 percentage point overweight captured three years of leadership: +60% (2023), +37% (2024), +24.4% (2025). However, Goldman Sachs identifies specific risks. AI hyperscaler capex reached $106 billion in Q3 2024, up 75%, with 2026 consensus at $527 billion. Current AI capex equals 0.8% of GDP versus 1.5% at historical peaks.

Critical risk emerges from data center capacity research showing base case occupancy peaking at 93% in 2026, but downside scenario models 80% by 2030 if monetization disappoints. Stock correlation across AI hyperscalers declined from 80% to 20%, suggesting emerging discrimination between winners and losers.

Fidelity emphasizes 60% of GDP growth in 2025 was driven by AI buildout. This concentrated thematic spending resembles late 1990s telecom or 2006-2007 housing, where capital expenditure cycles normalized causing sector corrections. Goldman Sachs notes timing of capex growth slowdown poses valuation risk.

**Strong Growth Factor Tilt:**

The growth/value score of +0.52 captured growth outperformance of approximately 135 percentage points cumulatively from 2020-2025. AssetMark confirms growth beat value throughout 2024 as investors bet on AI. However, the market delivered two consecutive years of 20%+ returns not seen since late 1990s. AssetMark notes 10-year Treasury yield rose 70 basis points to 4.58% despite Fed cuts. Higher real yields favor value over growth.

**Momentum Concentration:**

High-momentum positions at 27% weight generated 48.3% of returns. Academic research documents momentum crashes of 35-47% over weeks. Goldman Sachs shows correlation across AI hyperscalers declining from 80% to 20%, indicating investors discriminating within the momentum trade. Historical crashes include March 2000 (47%), October 2008 (42%), March 2020 (38%).

**Quality Factor Strength:**

The 53.2% allocation to high-quality stocks explains 84.4% win rate. Five of seven losers fall into lower quality: CVS, CCI, INTC, HI, GEO. The 45-fold Sharpe difference between high quality (0.45) and lower quality (0.01) validates importance. Goldman Sachs notes investors reward companies demonstrating clear capex-to-revenue links while rotating away from companies where earnings face pressure.

**Defensive Gap:**

Defensive sectors represent only 8.9% (Healthcare 8.0%, Utilities 1.5%) versus 32.3% cyclicals. Goldman Sachs data center research identifies recession as specific risk, with AI Downside case showing occupancy dropping to 80% if economy slows. This linkage between economic weakness and AI infrastructure creates amplified recession risk.

**Market Concentration:**

AssetMark documents Magnificent Seven accounting for 55% of return, top 10 stocks at 39% of index weight. Only 30% of stocks outperformed. Our portfolio holds four Magnificent Seven (AAPL, META, GOOGL, AMZN) at 22.36% combined weight, amplifying market-level concentration. Most alpha came from mega cap overweight rather than broad stock selection.

## Conclusion

The SMIF portfolio demonstrates strong historical performance with 85.91% cumulative return and exceptional risk-adjusted metrics. The Sharpe ratio of 2.76 substantially exceeds typical active managers at 0.7-1.0, while 84.4% win rate shows effective stock selection.

However, performance concentrates in specific positions, sectors, and factors. Three positions contribute 41.7% of returns from 21.6% capital. Technology positioning at 37.8% captured three years of leadership. Growth tilt of +0.52 benefited from unprecedented dominance. High-momentum at 27% generated 48.3% of returns. Quality bias at 53.2% contributed to high win rates.

Forward risks stem from mean-reversion potential. Technology concentration creates 8.7% downside in 20% sector correction, amplified by AI infrastructure spending questions Goldman Sachs identifies. Growth tilt produces 7.4% loss in rotation after five years of dominance. Momentum exposure generates 9.5% decline if reversal occurs. Defensive gap leaves portfolio vulnerable to 19.8% recession decline.

Market structure amplifies risks. AssetMark documents concentration reaching historic extremes with Magnificent Seven accounting for 55% of return and top 10 at 39% of index. The portfolio's 22.36% weight in four Magnificent Seven plus broader mega cap concentration means performance depends on continued narrow leadership.

Goldman Sachs Research provides validation for technology risks. AI hyperscaler capex consensus stands at $527 billion for 2026, but current 0.8% of GDP sits below historical peaks at 1.5%. Data center scenarios range from continued tightening to occupancy dropping to 80% if monetization disappoints. Stock correlations declining from 80% to 20% suggests investors discriminating within the previously monolithic trade.

The portfolio benefited from positioning correctly for technology leadership, growth dominance, and mega cap momentum during 2023-2025. These same choices create asymmetric risk if factors rotate, AI spending normalizes, or market leadership broadens. Understanding concentration in return sources, sectors, and factors allows informed assessment of whether current positioning remains appropriate given forward market conditions versus historical patterns that generated the 85.91% return.

The strong foundation, evidenced by Sharpe 2.76 and quality bias producing 84.4% win rate, provides flexibility. The analysis identifies specific exposures through scenario testing, quantifying technology correction at 8.7%, value rotation at 7.4%, momentum reversal at 9.5%, and recession at 19.8%. These quantified risks inform decisions about whether to maintain concentration or adjust positioning as market conditions evolve.

## Visual Analysis

The analysis includes six comprehensive visualizations documenting portfolio characteristics:

**Correlation Matrix:** Estimated correlations between top 15 holdings based on sector membership. Same-sector positions exhibit approximately 0.70 correlation while different sectors show 0.45. Technology positions cluster with high correlation, while healthcare and utilities provide diversification.
